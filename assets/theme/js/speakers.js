        talk: "In this talk, I introduce the topic of MLOps (machine learning operations), and expand on what it is, why is it needed, and why it (as a distinct field) has grown in popularity over the last 5 or so years. I then go into detail about what processes and capabilities a good MLOps solutions should entail, and the typical tech stack used to address and enable these. Lastly, I present a working MLOps solution that we (at Daemon) have developed in AWS, and run through a standard ML problem to showcase how MLOps can be used to speed up ML development time. Attendees of this talk should come away with knowledge around what MLOps is, why it is needed, and an idea of how it can be implemented. ",

      <br /><br />There are a host of reasons why machine learning models go can and do sideways.  In this session I'll use, sometimes embarrassing, anecdotes and examples from past experience to describe data and concept drift for ML applications.

How can you still deliver the results business needs? What about unconventional technologies? Does thinking outside the conventional box hold any promise? \
      <br/><br/>On a recent project, I was challenged to find ways to visualise data, but, I was not able to use the traditional tools. After trying out D3, I realised I needed even finer control over what was happening and had to find a better way forward. Throw in the complication of needing a web and desktop application, plus potentially mobile somewhere down the road, and things looked a bit bleak. \
      <br/><br/>Yet, I found a surprising answer, one that allowed me to meet all the project requirements and deliver real business value. Best of all, I could share code between the different environments and deliver results quickly. \

    title: "How to do everything right and still fail - a story from the data engineering frontlines at the City of Cape Town",
    talk: "The caricature of an engineer is a socially maladjusted nerd who prefers solving technical problems than having to interact with people. This story is mostly a lie, since engineers almost always have to work with large teams of people to get anything done. However, all stories have a basis in truth, and the truth is that we do sometimes get the people stuff wrong. \
    <br/><br/>I will use an example from my work in the Data Science branch at the City of Cape Town as a cautionary tale of \"getting the people stuff wrong\". The story relates to data infrastructure we have developed and deployed relating to information about loadshedding in the City of Cape Town. \
    <br/><br/>Earlier this year, in a ridiculously short amount of time, we automated the workflow around updating the Ciy's loadshedding schedule, and removed considerable risk of residents being misinformed. We went from a method of updating the schedule that involved many, redudant people from different departments, semiofficial WhatsApp groups and magic spreadsheets, to a world that looked like best practice - only the one or two people needed involved, serverless infrastructure, exposing useful data in machine readable format. I would spend a little time describing what we built since I think it would be of technical interest to the audience, and I'm proud of it.\
    <br/><br/>However, the roll out has not been smooth. I will spend the rest of the talk describing where and when in the process we missed opportunities to engage critical stakeholders, their perspectives, and have conversations that needed to be had. I will also spend some time casting a more charitable light on the \"old\" way of doing things, talking about the value of social relationships and feedback loops. \
    <br/><br/>While the project has not been a failure by any stretch of the imagination, it could have been better, and this talk will be my opportunity to get this off my chest!",
